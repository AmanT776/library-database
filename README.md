# 📚 Library Management System

## 📝 Project Description

The **Library Management System** is a relational database built with **MySQL** that manages books, authors, library members, and book loans. It simulates how a real library operates by keeping track of:

* Book inventory and categories
* Book-author relationships (many-to-many)
* Member information and joining date
* Book borrow and return transactions

It demonstrates the use of **primary keys, foreign keys, and many-to-many relationships**, and enforces **data integrity** using SQL constraints.

## 🗂️ Database Structure

### Tables:

* `Authors`: Author information
* `Books`: Book records
* `BookAuthors`: M\:N linking table between books and authors
* `Categories`: Book genres
* `Members`: Library members
* `Loans`: Book borrow/return records

### Relationships:

* One-to-many: `Categories` → `Books`
* One-to-many: `Members` → `Loans`
* Many-to-many: `Books` ↔ `Authors` (via `BookAuthors`)
